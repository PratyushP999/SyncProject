# Sync Intern: Python Developer Intern
# Desktop Notification and Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Project
This project consists of two parts: a desktop notification application and a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The goal of the project is to demonstrate your ability to create applications using Python.

## [Desktop Notification](https://github.com/panda057/SyncProject/blob/main/task1.py)
The desktop notification application will display a notification on the user's desktop to remind them to take a break or do some stretching. The user can customize the notification message and frequency.

A display area to show the score

For this you need to import random module and count number of Wins any with higher number of Wins is the Winner.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies be used in this project:

Python for the functionality of the desktop notification and the Rock-Paper-Scissors game

## How to Use
To use the desktop notification and Rock-Paper-Scissors game, make sure you have Python installed on your local machine. Then, clone the repository to your local machine and run the Python script in the terminal. You can then make changes to the code to customize the project to your needs.

> Note: It is recommended to have basic knowledge of Python to make changes to the code.

## Conclusion
This project provides you with an opportunity to showcase your skills as a Python developer and demonstrate your ability to create a complete and functional application using Python. By completing this project, you will have a portfolio of work that you can use to showcase your skills to potential employers or clients.
